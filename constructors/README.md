## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Key Points to Remember

### Constructors:
- [ ] Same name as class, no return type
- [ ] Called automatically when object is created
- [ ] Can be overloaded
- [ ] Types: Default, Parameterized, Copy
- [ ] Initialization list vs assignment in constructor body
- [ ] Cannot be virtual

### Destructors:
- [ ] Name: ~ClassName()
- [ ] No parameters, no return type
- [ ] Only one destructor per class
- [ ] Called when object goes out of scope
- [ ] Should be virtual in base class if inheritance is used
- [ ] Used for cleanup (deallocate memory, close files, etc.)
