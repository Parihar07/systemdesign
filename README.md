# System Design & C++ Interview Preparation

A comprehensive resource for mastering **System Design**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **C++ fundamentals** for technical interviews.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- **Interview preparation**: Brush up on core concepts before technical rounds
- **Learning system design**: Step-by-step exploration of OOP principles
- **Hands-on practice**: Working code examples with detailed explanations
- **Community resource**: Anyone interested in strengthening their C++ and system design knowledge

## 📚 What's Inside

### Current Topics

#### 1. [Access Modifiers](./acessmodifiers/)
Complete guide to C++ access control mechanisms.

**Covers:**
- `public`, `protected`, `private` access specifiers
- Access vs Visibility (compilation phases)
- Friend mechanism (not an access specifier!)
- Protected access rules ("through what object?")
- Inheritance and access control
- Real-world examples and interview questions

**Includes 4 Working Examples:**
- `example1/` - Basic access control & visibility
- `example2/` - Protected "through what?" rule
- `example3/` - Real-world: Bank account system
- `example4/` - Inheritance types (public/protected/private)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
- Terminal/command line familiarity

### Running Examples

Each topic directory contains runnable examples:

```bash
# Navigate to a topic
cd acessmodifiers/example1

# Compile
g++ -o am.out am.cpp

# Run
./am.out
```

Refer to individual README files for specific compilation instructions.

## 📖 Learning Path

### For Interview Prep:
1. **Start with fundamentals**: Access modifiers, encapsulation
2. **Move to OOP concepts**: Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
3. **Study design patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
4. **Practice system design**: Design real-world systems

### Recommended Order:
- ✅ Access Modifiers (Available now)
- 🔜 Const Correctness
- 🔜 Virtual Functions & Polymorphism
- 🔜 RAII & Smart Pointers
- 🔜 Move Semantics
- 🔜 Design Patterns
- 🔜 System Design Case Studies

## 💡 Interview Tips

**Key Principles to Remember:**
1. **Understand the "why"**: Don't just memorize—understand the reasoning
2. **Practice explaining**: Can you explain it to someone else?
3. **Code without IDE**: Practice writing code by hand or in simple editors
4. **Think about trade-offs**: Every design decision has pros and cons
5. **Real-world context**: Connect concepts to actual software problems

**During Interviews:**
- Clarify requirements before coding
- Think out loud—show your thought process
- Start with a simple solution, then optimize
- Discuss edge cases and error handling
- Know the time/space complexity
