# Lambda Expressions in C++

This file demonstrates a wide range of lambda expression features in C++ with minimal, well-commented examples. Each section is implemented as a separate function and called from `main()` for clarity and learning.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic lambda syntax**
2. **Capturing variables (by value, by reference, mixed)**
3. **Lambdas with STL algorithms**
4. **Mutable lambdas**
5. **Lambdas with explicit return type**
6. **Lambdas and std::function**
7. **Generic lambdas (C++14+)**
8. **Lambdas in multithreading**
9. **Lambdas as strategy (passing as function argument)**

## How to Use

- Compile and run `lambda_explanation.cpp` to see output for each example.
- Each function is self-contained and demonstrates a specific lambda feature.
- Read the comments in code for detailed explanations.
